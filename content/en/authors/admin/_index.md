I am Lee Soo-hyung from Chonbuk National University, majoring in computer artificial intelligence. My field of interest is web full-stack development. I am currently a member of the ALPS, an academic club of the Department of Computer Artificial Intelligence of Chonbuk National University, and I am working with my team members to solve coding test problems by learning algorithms and data structures every week.
